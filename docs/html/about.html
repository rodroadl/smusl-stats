                    <p>The Southern Maine United Soccer League plays from June to October at field locations in the greater Portland area. 
                        The league is a Men's league (although women are invited to play) and will offer both league and playoff games.</p>

                    <h1 align="center">The case for the Elo ratings</h1>
                    <p>TLDR: Common metrics to measure team strengths such as titles or points are insufficient 
                        and sometimes misleading as they do not sufficiently account for the random nature of football nor opposition strength.
                        The Elo ratings on this website provide a strength estimation based on results 
                        for every club that participated in SMUSL in past and present while trying to consider these factors optimally.</p>
                    
                    <h2 align="center">Where wide-spread metrics fall short</h2>
                    <p>It is said that anything can happen in a single game. Even when clubs are classes apart, 
                        the outsider might win once in a while. When the difference in quality is smaller, 
                        the outcome of a single game is even less predictable.</p>

                    <h3 align="center">Titles</h3>
                    <p>Greatness is often measured in the number of trophies collected. While certainly 
                        better clubs win more titles than worse clubs, it is still a very unprecise measure.
                        In a knock-out competition, only the winner survives each round, with the big random element 
                        in each single game influencing the outcome drastically.
                        League titles are not the best metric either. Due to the randomness of the game, 
                        winning a league by a few points makes it only a bit more likely for the first placed team to be actually 
                        better than the second placed team. If the points difference is bigger, then it is a lot more likely. 
                        In your trophy cabinet, this does not matter, both count equally and the second club gets nothing just like every other team.</p>

                    <h3 align="center">Points</h3>
                    <p>So should we rather look for the number of points that a club achieved in a league to determine how good it is? 
                        There are a few problems with that as well:
                        Firstly, the three-point-rule. Winning and losing is worth more than drawing twice while both actually mean that you are on average as good as the opposition.
                        Secondly, points do not take into account quality of opposition. You get more points against weaker teams than against strong teams, 
                        measures like points per game ignore that completely. You could say that in a full season this equals out for all clubs.
                        Thirdly, the arbitrary cut-off point. When looking at points, a game at the beginning of the season counts as much as the game last week 
                        even though the game last week tells us probably more about the current strength of a team than a game months ago. Points or points-per-game ignore that.</p>

                    <h2 align="center">What Elo can do about this</h2>
                    <p>Elo estimates the strength of a club based on the results against opponents and their strength.</p>

                    <h3 align="center">Quantify quality</h3>
                    <p>The Elo system works with only a single number, the Elo value. The difference 
                        in Elo points between two teams directly translates to a likelyhood of winning 
                        against that team. When a club with a 20% winning probability (and 80% losing 
                        probability, draw counting as half win/ half loss) wins it will gain 4 times more 
                        Elo points than when it loses so that the two clubs Elo values will remain stable 
                        relative to each other if the club actually wins 20% of the games. Should the club 
                        win more than 20%, their Elo values will converge accordingly.</p>

                    <h3 align="center">Recognise over/underperforming</h3>
                    <p>The expected number of Elo points gained from the next match is always zero. 
                        That means that over and underperforming over one or more games can be recognised 
                        by the number of Elo points won or lost in this/these games. That makes it 
                        very easy to actually judge how good a result or set of results has/have been.</p>

                    <h3 align="center">Recent results are weighted more strongly</h3>
                    <p>Every game's influence decreases when new games are played. In this way, 
                        a club's Elo rating is a combination of all its past results with games 
                        from the distant past having only a microscopic influence and newest games 
                        influencing the rating most. This effect can be increased or decreased by 
                        changing a parameter in the Elo equation and is chosen so that predictability is maximised.</p>

                    <h2 align="center">Where Elo falls short</h2>
                    <p>Elo does only consider results, it completely ignores how the game went. 
                        There are metrics that are less affected by randomness that actualy look into
                         what happens on the pitch. These methods can however introduce a bias 
                         as the result is what clubs play for. How big the reduced randomness 
                         and introduced bias compare depends on the method and is not always easy to quantify.</p>
